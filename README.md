Dhillon's Energy Game is a 3D game designed for children with energy-related diseases.
The game was designed in Unity.
The object of the game is to go throughout a schoolday controlling the main character and to make the best possible
energy-conserving decisions in order to gain energy in the energy bars on the lower left.  Once you finish all the tasks
for the day and go to bed, you turn into a superhero "Hornet Boy."  You can then shoot energy orbs at "nightmares" to destroy
them, until you wake up the next day and carry out new tasks.

I designed the entire game map and physics using Blender and Unity.  I also created all of the daytime events in C# and
using Unity. I connected the daily events to the daytime events to the user interface using C#.  I created the sequence
of events or objectives that occur, and updated the user interface appropriately to inform the player of what to do next
using C#.
